# MouseMover
Completely moral simple mouse mover made in python.

There is no fireworks. It relies on pyautogui, moves mouse to screen center, then moves it in a square shape, one move in a random time between 1 and 5 seconds. Should be able to keep computer awake.

Libraries required to compile by yourself via PyInstaller:
-pyautogui

.exe in this repo has been made via, PyInstaller --onefile.
